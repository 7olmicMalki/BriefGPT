The main idea of the book is that men are drawn to women who are strong, confident and independent, not to women who are needy, clingy and submissive. Argov argues that women who act like "bitches" (in a positive sense) are more likely to get respect, admiration and commitment from men than women who act like "doormats". She also provides practical tips and examples on how to be a "bitch" without being rude, mean or disrespectful.
 
Some of the topics that Argov covers in her book include:
 
- How to avoid being too nice and accommodating to men
- How to maintain your own identity and interests in a relationship
- How to communicate your needs and desires without nagging or complaining
- How to create mystery and excitement in your relationship
- How to handle conflicts and arguments with grace and humor
- How to make him chase you and value you more

The book is written in a witty and humorous style, with plenty of anecdotes and quotes from real women and men. It is easy to read and understand, and it will make you laugh and nod along as you recognize yourself or your partner in some of the situations. The book is also full of practical exercises and quizzes that will help you apply the concepts to your own life.
 
If you want to learn how to be a woman who men love, respect and adore, you should definitely read *Kodel Vyrai Myli Kales* by Sherry Argov. You will not only improve your relationship with your man, but also with yourself. You will discover how to be more confident, happy and fulfilled as a woman.
  
One of the most important concepts that Argov introduces in her book is the difference between a "nice girl" and a "bitch". A nice girl is a woman who tries to please everyone, especially men. She is always agreeable, accommodating and available. She puts her own needs and wants aside and focuses on making her man happy. She is afraid of losing him or upsetting him, so she never says no or stands up for herself. She is also insecure and needy, constantly seeking his approval and validation.
 
A bitch, on the other hand, is a woman who knows her worth and respects herself. She is not afraid to say no or express her opinions. She has her own life and interests outside of the relationship. She does not depend on her man for happiness or fulfillment. She is confident and self-reliant, and she does not need his approval or validation. She also knows how to have fun and enjoy life.
 
Argov explains that men are naturally attracted to bitches because they are challenging, exciting and unpredictable. They are not easy to get or control, and they make men work harder to win them over. They also keep men on their toes and prevent them from getting bored or complacent. Bitches also inspire men to be better versions of themselves, because they have high standards and expectations.
 
Argov also warns women not to confuse being a bitch with being a jerk. A jerk is a woman who is rude, mean and disrespectful to men. She is selfish, manipulative and dishonest. She does not care about anyone but herself, and she hurts men intentionally or carelessly. She is also insecure and unhappy, and she tries to bring others down to her level.
 
A bitch is not a jerk. She is respectful, honest and loyal to men. She cares about them and treats them well, but she does not let them take advantage of her or mistreat her. She is also happy and positive, and she brings joy and value to others.
