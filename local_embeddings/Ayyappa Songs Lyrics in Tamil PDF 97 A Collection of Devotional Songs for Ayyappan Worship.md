## Ayyappa Worship Rituals: How to Show Devotion to Ayyappan
 
Ayyappan is not only worshipped through songs, but also through various rituals and ceremonies that demonstrate the devotees' devotion and dedication to him. These rituals and ceremonies vary according to the region, tradition, and personal preference of the devotees, but they generally share some common elements and purposes.
 
One of the most common rituals of Ayyappan worship is puja, or devotional worship, which involves offering prayers, flowers, fruits, incense, lamps, and other items to an image or symbol of Ayyappan. Puja can be performed at home, in a temple, or at a sacred place associated with Ayyappan, such as Sabarimala or Erumeli. Puja can be done daily, weekly, monthly, or on special occasions, such as festivals or birthdays. Puja is a way of expressing one's love, gratitude, and surrender to Ayyappan, and seeking his blessings and protection.
 
Another common ritual of Ayyappan worship is abhisheka, or ritual bathing, which involves pouring water or other liquids, such as milk, honey, ghee, or coconut water, over an image or symbol of Ayyappan. Abhisheka can be done as part of puja, or separately, at home or in a temple. Abhisheka is a way of honoring and purifying Ayyappan, and also cleansing oneself of sins and impurities.
 
Devotees also observe various vows and practices as a form of devotion to Ayyappan. These vows and practices may include observing a period of austerity (vrata), abstaining from certain activities (such as meat-eating, alcohol consumption, shaving, cutting hair or nails), wearing black or blue clothes (the colors associated with Ayyappan), wearing a rosary (mala) made of rudraksha or tulsi beads around the neck (as a symbol of initiation), chanting Ayyappan's names or mantras (such as Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa), reading Ayyappan's stories or scriptures (such as the Bhagavad Gita), meditating on Ayyappan's form or qualities (such as his celibacy or compassion), performing charity (dana) or service (seva) to others (especially the poor or needy), visiting Ayyappan's temples or shrines (especially Sabarimala), and participating in group worship (satsang) or processions (rath yatra) with other devotees.
 
These vows and practices are meant to help the devotees develop a closer relationship with Ayyappan, and also to prepare themselves for the ultimate pilgrimage to Sabarimala. The pilgrimage to Sabarimala is considered to be the culmination of one's devotion to Ayyappan, and also a symbolic journey of one's spiritual transformation. The pilgrimage involves climbing the 18 sacred steps (pathinettu padikal) that lead to the sanctum sanctorum of Ayyappan's temple at Sabarimala. The 18 steps represent the 18 weapons that Ayyappan used to defeat the demoness Mahishi, as well as the 18 aspects of human personality that one has to overcome in order to attain liberation. The devotees carry an offering (irumudi kettu) on their heads, which contains two compartments: one for their personal belongings and another for their offerings to Ayyappan. The offerings may include coconut filled with ghee (neyy thenga), rice (ari), jaggery (sharkara), plantain (kadali), betel leaves and nuts (vettila pakku), camphor (karpooram), incense sticks (agarbatti), sandalwood paste (chandanam), turmeric powder (manjal podi), vermilion powder (kumkumam), rose water (gulab jal), honey (then), sugar candy (kalkandu), dried grapes (draksha), cardamom (elakka), cloves (grambu), etc. The devotees also carry a cloth bundle (pattu kettu) containing a new set of clothes for themselves.
 
The pilgrimage to Sabarimala is not an easy one. It involves walking through forests and
